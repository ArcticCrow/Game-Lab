# 2 Button Games (Hanze Game Lab 2018/2019)
## Client Description
### Short Problem Statement
Physical handicaps can have huge influences on a person’s quality of life. This does not only concern
limitations to productivity for society, but also limitations of relaxing activities and hobbies. In this
project we want to develop a game for a handicapped person to support social interactions and for
spending free time.

Here we present the case of Jeroen, who has virtually no control over the muscles of his
extremities; he can only –to some extent- control his head movements. His head is supported by a 
headrest which contains two movable parts at the left and the right sides of his head. By pushing
his head against those movable parts micro switches are activated, the signals of which are input
into a tablet or PC.

In this project a game should be developed, in which Jeroen has full control over all relevant
aspects of the game. The other players (minimum 1, max 3) control their part of the game in the
same way as Jeroen does, but they use a different controller instead of the micro switches.

### Expectations
Jeroen expects to obtain a fully functional game or series of games,  in which all the rules of the
game are automatically taken care of. The actions to be taken by Jeroen need to be minimal in
number (because of the required effort for him) while at the same time he needs to have full
control over the game, just like the other players have.

_Note: Jeroen has better/faster control over the right micro switch. The left micro switch requires
more effort._

1. The games are simple to understand and control.
2. The games have settings to be applicable to different amounts of players. 
3. The games have adaptable input methods to fit  different kinds of disabled people.
4. The games have a fitting business case to ensure multiple games can be built.
